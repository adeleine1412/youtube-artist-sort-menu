# youtube artist sort menu
This script adds a dropdown menu to filter by most viewed, oldest and newest videos on artist channels. Right now, artist channels on Youtube hide the normal dropdown menu that appears on regular channels for sorting videos.

You can install the script from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/450761-sort-menu-for-arist-channel) or by clicking [here](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/450761-sort-menu-for-arist-channel/code/Sort%20menu%20for%20arist%20channel.user.js).
